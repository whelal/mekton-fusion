# Mekton Fusion FoundryVTT System

A **custom Foundry VTT system** that merges mechanics from **Mekton Zeta**, **Cyberpunk 2020**, and **The Witcher TRPG** into a unified ruleset.

> Fusion of Mekton concepts with Cyberpunk 2020 style stats & skills plus Witcher TRPG inspired magic (Signs + Psionics scaffold). This system is **early stage (v0.0.x)** and APIs / data schema may still change.

---
## üìñ Overview
Built on inspirations from:
- **Cyberpunk 2020 Foundry system** (stats & skills model)
- **The Witcher TRPG Foundry system** (spell / sign structure & magical flavor)
- **Mekton Zeta** (mecha combat + future planned construction features)

The goal: Provide a **complete character sheet and rules support** for campaigns mixing **mecha, cyberpunk, and fantasy elements**.

Core areas:
- Character stats & skill checks (CP2020 style)
- Spell / Sign & future Psionics framework (Witcher inspired)
- Planned: Mecha design, vehicle frames, loadouts

---
## ‚ú® Current Feature Set
- Uppercase stat block: `INT REF TECH COOL ATTR LUCK MA BODY EMP EDU`
- Cyberpunk-style header & compact stat boxes with inline roll buttons
- Bidirectional exploding d10 rolls (10 chains up, 1 chains down, capped extras, flags include raw dice)
- Initiative: `1d10 + REF`
- Skill & Spell (Sign) seeding (auto on new actor + manual Add Skills button + world seeding macro)
- Categorized skill display with favorites filter & sorting (name/stat/rank/total)
- Hard skill markers `(H)` with localization support
- DataModel-backed stats schema (Foundry VTT v13+)
- Migration logic for legacy `system.abilities` (WILL‚ÜíCOOL, MOVE‚ÜíMA)
- Centralized stat defaults (`module/data/defaults.js`)
- Basic i18n keys (`lang/en.json`)
- Manual & auto skill seeding; canonicalization of Mecha Gunnery variants
- Actor meta fields: Role, Age, Points (header inputs)

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0.0.x | Core stats + skills + signs seeding | In progress |
| 0.1.0 | Derived values (HP calc, encumbrance stub) | Planned |
| 0.2.0 | Vehicle & Mecha item types / sheets | Planned |
| 0.3.0 | Psionics / advanced powers | Planned |
| 0.4.0 | Expanded localization / community translation | Planned |

## üì¶ Installation (Development)
1. Place (clone or copy) this folder into your Foundry `Data/systems` directory.
2. Restart Foundry.
3. Create / load a world and select "Mekton Fusion" as the system.
4. Use the provided macro `macros/seed-core-data.macro.js` or Add Skills button if skills are empty.

Optional (git):
```bash
cd /path/to/FoundryVTT/Data/systems
git clone https://github.com/whelal/mekton-fusion.git
```

---
## üß¨ Actor Data Schema (Simplified)
```js
system: {
  meta: { role: string, age: number, points: number },
  stats: {
    INT:{value}, REF:{value}, TECH:{value}, COOL:{value}, ATTR:{value},
    LUCK:{value}, MA:{value}, BODY:{value}, EMP:{value}, EDU:{value}
  },
  skills: { /* legacy inline map (deprecated) */ },
  // Skills & spells preferred as embedded Item documents
}
```
Legacy `system.abilities` (lowercase) auto-migrates when opening actor sheets; WILL ‚Üí COOL, MOVE ‚Üí MA.

---
## üîÑ Migration & Seeding
- Opening actors triggers stat shape normalization `{ value }`.
- World seeding macro populates global Items (skills/spells) & updates actors.
- New actors auto-seed default skills & signs (character & npc types).
- Manual per-actor Add Skills button appears when no skills are present.

### Re-run seeding world-wide (console)
```js
(async ()=>{ const { seedWorldData } = await import(game.modules.get('mekton-fusion') ? '' : 'systems/mekton-fusion/module/seed.js'); await seedWorldData(); })();
```

---
## üé≤ Rolling System
- Base stat roll: 1d10 (exploding 10 up / 1 down) + STAT (+ Rank for skills)
- Chains capped (config constant) to avoid runaway explosion
- Roll flags: `roll.flags['mekton-fusion'] = { plusDice, minusDice, capped }`
- Chat flavor shows breakdown & explosion tags

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Development Layout
```
module/
  data/ (defaults, skills, spells, actor-data-model)
  seed.js (world + actor core item seeding)
  settings.js (future system settings)
  sheets/item-sheet.js
scripts/sheets/
  actor-sheet.js (sheet logic, rolls, UI state)
  mekton-fusion.js (init hooks, sheet registration, initiative, auto-seed)
styles/ (CSS: mekton-fusion.css)
templates/actor/
  actor-sheet.hbs (main sheet)
lang/en.json
system.json
```

---
## üåê Internationalization
Add another language by copying `lang/en.json` to e.g. `lang/fr.json` and adding the language entry in `system.json` (planned). Most UI keys already namespaced under `MF.*`.

---
## üöß Known Gaps
- No derived HP / encumbrance formulas yet
- No mecha sheet implementation (planned)
- Limited validation on skill rank editing
- No automated full migration script (opportunistic only)
- Minimal test harness

---
## ü§ù Contributing
Issues & PRs welcome (once repository stabilizes). Priority contributions:
- Derived stat formula proposals
- Mecha/vehicle schema design
- Localization packs
- Additional item / power categories
